I think i'll be doing a simple ToDo List as a secondary project to learn more about this language.
I won't be adding to much features since this is supposed to be a simple and fast project.

Btw, i used this repo as a guide https://github.com/BekBrace/inv-tui-go/blob/main/main.go.
Obviously im going to add more thingies later on
