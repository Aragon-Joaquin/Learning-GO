# ðŸš€ A new journey. Learning Go.

### Why?

Most important , i want to improve. **I need to.**

I want to be a good developer and to achieve that goal is learning a new programming languages since it will be introducing me a ton of concepts that i will be explaining and writing on my book.

In this repository i will be posting some of my learnings and i hope that it will help you to learn Go too or at least convince you to try it.
